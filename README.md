# Pig-Game
summary of this code 
This code is for a game of Pig Dice. It uses JavaScript to create a game where two players can roll a die and accumulate points.
The game is played on a website with elements such as buttons, dice images, and score displays. When the player rolls a 1, 
the turn is passed to the next player. When a player reaches a score of 100 or more, the game is over and that player is
declared the winner. The 'use strict' at the top of the code is a directive to the JavaScript engine to use strict mode, 
which is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript.


This code is well organized and easy to understand. It uses "use strict" at the top to indicate that the script should be executed in strict mode.
It also uses the DOM API to select and manipulate the elements on the page, such as buttons, dice images, and score displays.
The game logic is well structured, with functions for initializing the game, switching players, rolling the dice, and holding the score.
The code also makes good use of event listeners to handle user interactions with the buttons.
Overall, it's a well-written and functional code for a game of Pig Dice.
